# Autograder
This project is a collection of scripts that implements an automatic grading system. The system can be used to grade programming assignments written in a variety of languages. It also includes scripts to interact with Canvas (or another LMS).

The script takes care of a lot of the boring and time-consuming grunt-work associated with grading programs (downloading submissions, organizing student work, compiling, running tests, producing reports, uploading student feedback). The system gives you a good sketch of a programsâ€™ correctness leaving only a brief manual review to be done.
