# Autograder

This project is a framework for writing scripts that automatically grade programming assignments written in a variety of languages. The framework takes care of a lot of the boring and time-consuming work associated with grading student programs (downloading submissions, organizing student work, compiling, running tests, producing reports, uploading student feedback). 

The framework was inspired by JUnit and is designed with homework grading in mind. A grading script gives you a good sketch of a programs' correctness leaving only a brief manual review to be done.

Autograder:

- lets you create grading scripts with simple commands
- provides a set of flexible test cases 
- allows users to add test cases for specific requirements
- interacts with Canvas (or another LMS)
- provides for robograding where students promptly get automated feedback
