# Getting Started

The Autograde system makes use of a web server for the manager.html page. The manager.html page provides a control panel for the grading process. PHP is required for the scripts. In addition, the grading system makes use of a MySQL database for some TestCase operations.

To install the web server, PHP and MySQL, I suggest using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). XAMPP is a free open-source package that makes installation of Apache, MySQL and PHP very easy.

## Installing the Grading System

1. Create or locate a folder that is accessible by the web server for the grading system files. For example, I added the following to the httpd.conf file in the ScriptAlias area:

        Alias /tools "C:/Courses/tools"
        <Directory "C:/Courses/tools">
            Options Indexes MultiViews
            AllowOverride None
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>

    The above configuration allows access by [http://localhost/tools] to run the manager.html file.

2. Download or put the autograde5.zip file inside the grading folder.

3. Unzip autograde5.zip inside the grading folder. The unzipping process will create a new subfolder named "autograde5" (without the quotes).

4. Setup the manager.html page by opening the canvasAPI.php file in the "lib" subfolder and updating the following as described below.
a. CACERT_PATH
b. $canvasDomain
c. $token

5. The CACERT_PATH is the path to the folder with the cacert.pem file. The cert file is needed for some cURL operations. For Windows, need SSL CA cert from: <https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html>.

    - Download on the page from link **cacert.pem**
    - Save in location of your choice and update the cacert path to match your location.

6. The `$canvasDomain` is the URL for the Canvas API for your college. For Cabrillo College this URL would be:
    [https://cabrillo.instructure.com/api/v1]

7. The `$token` is a cryptographically unique string of characters and numbers you must generate in Canvas. To generate the token, login to Canvas, go to "Accounts" and "Settings" and click on the "New Access Token" button. Copy the long string into the canvasAPI.php file and assign it to `$token`.
